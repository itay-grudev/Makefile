Makefile
========

This is a very simple Makefile template that supports source in multiple directories specified in the Makefile.

It is pretty straightforward, useful on a lot of simple C++ projects.

This source is based on the Makefile published by Ivan Tabashki (Under WTF Public License) with minor changes and improvements.

Usage
-----

There are some useful comments in the Makefile itself on setting it up. There is no help menu nor anything else. Just:

````
make
make clean
````

If you would like additional functionality - Feel free to add it.
